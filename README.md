# MonitoringPlotter
MonitoringPlotter is a shiny application for designing ecological surveys in a leaflet environment. The aim is for users to upload files and draw their own management sites, with the ability to randomly generate or place plots of a defined size (e.g. 50x20m). Then, simply download in their required format.
